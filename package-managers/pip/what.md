# pip


# One Sentence
* A shitty package manager for python, but it's the most common one and the one we're stuck with for many packages.


# Background
* The de facto python package manager. Used to be a lot worse.
* Use conda to manage user level python packages wherever possible. If using pip within conda, make sure to activate the desired conda env before running pip commands - otherwise an alternate "system" pip installation may be used that your distro installed to manage system python packages.
