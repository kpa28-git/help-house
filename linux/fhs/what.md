# Linux-FHS

# One Sentence
* The Linux File System Hierarchy Standard (FHS) defines a set of conventions for the directory structure of Linux distributions.

# Background
* The FHS is largely based on the Unix directory conventions.
* Other modern Unix-like systems (like BSDs) follow similar conventions to the FHS, but the FHS is not an authority for them.
* The FHS doesn't set conventions for user home directories.
