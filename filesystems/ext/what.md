# One Sentence
The ext4 file system is a modern journalling filesystem that is usually the default
choice on Linux.

# Background
The ext4 filesystem is an improvement over ext3, which itself improves on ext2.
The ext2 filesystem may be useful because it has native support on both FreeBSD
and Linux. Other than this case, ext4 should generally be preferred.
