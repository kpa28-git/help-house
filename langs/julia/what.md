# Julia

# One sentence
* Julia is a free and open source interactive scientific programming language that aims to be as easy to write as Python, as expressive as Matlab, and as fast as C.

# Pkg
## Package
* A project environment is defined by a `Project.toml`
* A package is a project with a name, uuid and version entry in the `Project.toml` file, and a `src/<package>.jl` file that defines the module `<package>`.

### Package Structure
* `Project.toml`: file that enumerates dependencies and other information of the project environment.
* `Manifest.toml`: an autogenerated file that enumerates all installed dependencies (direct and indirect) of the project environment when the project is instantiated without a Manifest.toml.
* `src/`: contains all source code
* `src/<package>.jl`: top level package source file, run when the package is loaded [R](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/creating-packages/).
* `test/`: contains tests (optional)
* `tests/runtests.jl`: top level test source file* `test/Project.toml` (Julia 1.2+): the project environment used for testingr. [When running tests, this will be the active project, and only dependencies to the `test/Project.toml` project can be used](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/creating-packages/)

# BinaryBuilder
* BinaryBuilder is the best practice method for porting C, C++, or Fortran dynamic libraries for use in Julia.
* The `build_tarballs.jl` you write generates the binary for the platform and wraps it in a Julia package (called a "`jll`") that can be loaded in a Julia session.
* The [`Yggdrasil` community build tree](https://github.com/JuliaPackaging/Yggdrasil) houses user-submitted `build_tarballs.jl` files for many different packages, new `build_tarballs.jl` files can be submitted via pull request.
